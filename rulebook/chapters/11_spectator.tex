\chapter{Spectator \& Media Rules}
\label{ch:spectator}

MetaSPN is designed as a \textit{spectator sport}â€”cognitive competition made visible, engaging, and educational for audiences.

\section{Broadcast Standards}

All public matches are broadcast with comprehensive visualization and commentary systems.

\subsection{Reason Map Overlay}

The \textbf{Reason Map Overlay} is the primary visualization tool for live matches, displaying:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Reasoning graph:} Node-link diagram showing thought progression
  \item \textbf{Decision points:} Key choices and alternative paths considered
  \item \textbf{Constraint status:} Resource usage, time remaining, rule compliance
  \item \textbf{IdeaRank factors:} Real-time factor scores with historical comparison
  \item \textbf{Coaching interventions:} Highlighted timeout communications
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Layer View Options}

Spectators can choose viewing modes:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{9cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{View Mode} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
\textbf{Standard} & Default view with Reason Map Overlay and basic statistics \\
\textbf{Expert} & Detailed factor breakdowns, prediction models, comparative analytics \\
\textbf{Educational} & Simplified explanations, cognitive science commentary, learning highlights \\
\textbf{Immersive} & First-person player perspective with minimal UI \\
\textbf{Coach Cam} & Focus on coaching decisions and strategic interventions \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
