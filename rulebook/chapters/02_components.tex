\label{ch:components}

Each MetaSPN match combines four core layers of cognitive competition:

\section{Game}

A \textbf{game} is a bounded challenge requiring structured reasoning.

Games in MetaSPN are selected from a curated library of cognitive tasks spanning:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Logic puzzles and constraint satisfaction
  \item Strategic decision-making scenarios
  \item Creative problem framing and solution design
  \item Knowledge synthesis and argumentation
  \item Adaptive learning and pattern recognition
\end{itemize}

Each game specifies:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Objective and success criteria
  \item Constraints (time, resources, information)
  \item Input format and expected output
  \item Evaluation rubric aligned with IdeaRank factors
\end{itemize}

\section{Coach}

A \textbf{coach} is a meta-agent guiding player development or decision-making.

Coaches may be:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Human mentors providing strategic guidance
  \item AI systems offering structured feedback
  \item Hybrid systems combining human intuition and AI analysis
\end{itemize}

Coach responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Pre-match briefing and strategy formation
  \item Timeout management and tactical interventions
  \item Post-match analysis and developmental feedback
  \item Long-term player progression planning
\end{itemize}

Coaches are \textit{scored} based on their impact on player performance (see Chapter \ref{ch:scoring}, Coaching Impact).

\section{League Structure}

The league structure defines skill tiers and appropriate pairing through a \textbf{class and division system}:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Classes} (A, B, C) differentiate skill levels and coaching intensity
  \item \textbf{Divisions} (1, 2, 3, Special) define player-coach pairing types
  \item \textbf{Meta Ratings} track long-term performance and enable ranking
\end{itemize}

See Chapters \ref{ch:classes} and \ref{ch:divisions} for complete details.

\section{Scoring}

Governed by \textbf{IdeaRank}, the official MetaSPN performance index.

IdeaRank-Thought (IR-T) provides a unified, multi-factor assessment of cognitive performance that accounts for:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Correctness and robustness
  \item Reasoning efficiency and clarity
  \item Originality and adaptation
  \item Coach effectiveness
\end{itemize}

See Chapter \ref{ch:scoring} for the complete scoring framework.

\section{The Integration}

These four components create a complete ecosystem:

\begin{center}
\textbf{Game} $\rightarrow$ provides the challenge\\
\textbf{Coach} $\rightarrow$ guides the player\\
\textbf{League Structure} $\rightarrow$ ensures appropriate matching\\
\textbf{Scoring} $\rightarrow$ makes performance visible and comparable
\end{center}

Together, they transform thought into sport.
