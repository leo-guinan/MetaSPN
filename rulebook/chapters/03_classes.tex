\section{Class A: Developmental / Coaching Up}

\subsection{Purpose}
Class A serves as the entry point for all participants. It emphasizes \textit{learning} over performance, with coaching focused on building foundational reasoning skills.

\subsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Timeouts:} 3 $\times$ 60 seconds
  \item \textbf{Coaching style:} Highly interactive, with scaffolding and process guidance
  \item \textbf{IdeaRank weight bonus:} +0.05 on Learning (L) factor
  \item \textbf{Coaching Impact modifier:} $\lambda = 0.15$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Structured problem-solving with clear constraints
  \item Pattern recognition and categorization
  \item Basic strategic planning
  \item Explanation and justification of reasoning
\end{itemize}

\section{Class B: Performance / Field Awareness}

\subsection{Purpose}
Class B represents professional-tier competition. Participants demonstrate competent reasoning skills and focus on execution quality and speed.

\subsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Timeouts:} 2 $\times$ 60 seconds
  \item \textbf{Coaching style:} Limited interventions, meta-guidance and strategic corrections
  \item \textbf{IdeaRank weight bonus:} +0.05 on Quality (Q) and Outcome Validity (O)
  \item \textbf{Coaching Impact modifier:} $\lambda = 0.20$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Complex multi-constraint optimization
  \item Real-time decision-making under uncertainty
  \item Advanced strategic gameplay
  \item High-quality communication and presentation
\end{itemize}

\section{Class C: Master / Meta-Coaching}

\subsection{Purpose}
Class C is the apex tier, featuring expert participants and experimental formats. Competition emphasizes reflective reasoning, coaching innovation, and meta-cognitive awareness.

\subsection{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Timeouts:} 1 $\times$ 90 seconds + 1 reflective timeout
  \item \textbf{Coaching style:} Coach-on-coach interaction, AI-assisted analysis, reflective strategy
  \item \textbf{IdeaRank weight bonus:} +0.05 on Trust (T) and Cohesion (C)
  \item \textbf{Coaching Impact modifier:} $\lambda = 0.30$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typical Challenges}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Open-ended research and synthesis problems
  \item Novel challenge design and framework creation
  \item Meta-reasoning about cognitive strategies
  \item Coaching system evaluation and improvement
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Advancement}

Participants advance between classes based on their Meta Rating (MR). See Chapter \ref{ch:advancement} for complete advancement criteria.
