\chapter{Scoring — "The Measure of Thought"}
\label{ch:scoring}

\section{The Principle of Measurement}

Scoring in MetaSPN exists to make thought visible, fair, and comparable.

\begin{principle}
\textbf{It's not about being right — it's about thinking well.}
\end{principle}

Every match is scored using \textbf{IdeaRank-Thought (IR-T)} — a unified algorithm derived from the six IdeaRank factors, expanded to include correctness, compliance, and coaching impact.

\section{Structure of Scoring}

Each round produces a composite score between \textbf{0.0} and \textbf{1.0}, computed as:

\begin{equation}
\text{IR-T} = O^{w_O} \times X^{w_X} \times U^{w_U} \times C^{w_C} \times L^{w_L} \times Q^{w_Q} \times T^{w_T} \times D^{w_D} \times (1 + \lambda \times \text{CI})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Scoring Factors}

The nine factors that comprise IdeaRank-Thought are defined as follows:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}clp{8cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Factor} & \textbf{Description} \\ \midrule
\textbf{O} & Outcome Validity & Correctness and robustness \\
\textbf{X} & Constraint Compliance & Adherence to rules, ethics, and resource limits \\
\textbf{U} & Uniqueness & Originality and creative problem framing \\
\textbf{C} & Cohesion & Logical and narrative consistency of reasoning \\
\textbf{L} & Learning & Progress, adaptation, and insight development \\
\textbf{Q} & Quality & Clarity, communicability, and polish \\
\textbf{T} & Trust & Verifiable grounding and testability \\
\textbf{D} & Density & Information efficiency and reasoning compactness \\
\textbf{CI} & Coach Impact & Measured influence of coaching interventions \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{IdeaRank-Thought Scoring Factors}
\label{tab:scoring_factors}
\end{table}

\section{Weights \& Class Modifiers}

Each class emphasizes different aspects of cognitive performance, reflected in factor weight adjustments:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}clcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Class} & \textbf{Focus} & \textbf{Weight Adjustment} & \textbf{Coaching Mod ($\lambda$)} \\ \midrule
\textbf{A} (Developmental) & Growth, learning & +0.05 on \textbf{L} & $\lambda = 0.15$ \\
\textbf{B} (Performance) & Execution \& clarity & +0.05 on \textbf{Q}, \textbf{O} & $\lambda = 0.20$ \\
\textbf{C} (Master) & Reflective \& meta-coaching & +0.05 on \textbf{T}, \textbf{C} & $\lambda = 0.30$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class-Based Weight Modifiers}
\label{tab:class_modifiers}
\end{table}

\section{Coaching Impact (CI)}

Coaching Impact measures the causal delta in player performance after coaching interventions:

\begin{equation}
\text{CI} = 0.6(\Delta\text{IR-T}) + 0.3(\text{plan adherence}) + 0.1(\text{challenge success})
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Positive CI} → Effective, timely guidance
  \item \textbf{Negative CI} → Detrimental or distracting coaching
  \item CI is capped at $\pm 1.0$
\end{itemize}

\section{Rounds \& Structure}

Each match includes three rounds:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Exploration} — Ideation
  \item \textbf{Execution} — Problem Solving
  \item \textbf{Reflection} — Justification
\end{enumerate}

Timeouts and challenges are tracked; all reasoning steps are logged to the \textbf{MetaSPN Ledger} for auditability.

\section{Ranking \& Advancement}

Player and Coach scores are averaged across matches to form \textbf{Meta Ratings (MR)}.

Promotions and class changes occur when MR thresholds are reached:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Transition} & \textbf{MR Threshold} \\ \midrule
\textbf{A $\rightarrow$ B} & $\geq 650$ \\
\textbf{B $\rightarrow$ C} & $\geq 800$ \\
\textbf{Master Certification} & $\geq 950$ and $\geq 10$ verified matches \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Advancement Thresholds}

\end{table}
