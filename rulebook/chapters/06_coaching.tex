% Chapter 6: Coaching Rules
\chapter{Coaching Rules}
\label{ch:coaching}

Coaches play a critical role in MetaSPN, shaping player strategy, decision-making, and long-term development. This chapter defines permissible coaching conduct and communication protocols.

\section{Communication Windows}

\subsection{Permitted Communication Times}

Coaching communication is allowed during:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Pre-Match Briefing} (5 minutes)
  \item \textbf{Timeouts} (duration varies by class)
  \item \textbf{Post-Match Analysis} (5 minutes)
  \item \textbf{Reflective Timeouts} (Class C only)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Visibility}

All coaching communication is \textbf{publicly visible} to the audience:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Audio transcribed in real-time
  \item Visual displays shown on Reason Map Overlay
  \item Archived for post-match review
\end{itemize}

This transparency ensures:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Fair evaluation of coaching impact
  \item Educational value for spectators
  \item Accountability in coach-player interactions
\end{itemize}

\section{Coaching Conduct}

\subsection{Permissible Coaching Activities}

Coaches \textbf{may}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Guide strategic approach and problem-solving structure
  \item Ask clarifying questions to prompt player reflection
  \item Highlight overlooked constraints or considerations
  \item Suggest alternative perspectives or framings
  \item Provide encouragement and manage player state
  \item Reference general principles and heuristics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prohibited Coaching Activities}

Coaches \textbf{may not}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Provide direct answers or solutions
  \item Execute reasoning steps on behalf of the player
  \item Access external resources not available to the player
  \item Communicate outside designated windows
  \item Provide misleading or deliberately harmful guidance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Violation Penalties}

Coaching violations incur a \textbf{Reason Integrity Penalty}:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Violation Type} & \textbf{IdeaRank Penalty} \\ \midrule
Direct solution provided & $-0.10$ \\
Misleading guidance (if intentional) & $-0.08$ \\
Unauthorized communication & $-0.05$ \\
Minor procedural infractions & $-0.02$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coaching Violation Penalties}
\label{tab:coaching_penalties}
\end{table}

Repeated or egregious violations may result in coach suspension or disqualification.

\section{Coach Substitution}

\subsection{Between-Round Substitution}

Teams may change coaches between rounds in \textbf{Class B} and \textbf{Class C} divisions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Substitution must be declared during transition period
  \item New coach receives 2-minute briefing from outgoing coach
  \item Both coaches' Coaching Impact (CI) scores are tracked separately
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mid-Round Substitution}

Mid-round substitution is \textit{not permitted} except in cases of technical failure or medical emergency, subject to referee approval.

\section{AI Coach Requirements}

When AI systems serve as coaches, additional transparency requirements apply:

\subsection{Pre-Match Declaration}

AI coaches must declare:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Model architecture} (e.g., transformer, retrieval-augmented, etc.)
  \item \textbf{Training data lineage} (cutoff date, domain coverage)
  \item \textbf{Parameter count and configuration}
  \item \textbf{Any fine-tuning or specialization} applied
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducibility}

AI coaching systems must be:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Deterministic or use fixed random seeds
  \item Capable of replay for verification purposes
  \item Free from hidden external data access during matches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretability}

AI coaches should provide reasoning traces when possible, allowing evaluation of coaching logic and decision-making.

\section{Coach Evaluation \& Coaching Impact (CI)}

Coaches are scored based on their measurable impact on player performance (see Chapter \ref{ch:scoring}, Section on Coaching Impact).

\subsection{Positive CI Indicators}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Player IdeaRank improvement following coaching interventions
  \item Successful navigation of challenges after strategic guidance
  \item High plan adherence (player follows coached strategy effectively)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative CI Indicators}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Player IdeaRank decline after coaching intervention
  \item Confusion or misdirection following coach guidance
  \item Overcorrection leading to abandonment of effective strategies
\end{itemize}

\section{Coach Development \& Advancement}

Coaches progress through their own ranking system based on sustained positive Coaching Impact:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Coach Certification Level} & \textbf{Requirements} \\ \midrule
\textbf{Level 1} (Novice) & Complete coach training; 5+ matches \\
\textbf{Level 2} (Certified) & Average CI $\geq +0.3$; 20+ matches \\
\textbf{Level 3} (Master Coach) & Average CI $\geq +0.5$; 50+ matches; Class C eligible \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
