\label{ch:advancement}

MetaSPN participants advance through classes based on demonstrated performance and consistency, measured by the \textbf{Meta Rating (MR)} system.

\section{Meta Rating (MR)}

Meta Rating is a composite score reflecting both immediate performance and long-term consistency.

\subsection{Player Meta Rating}

\begin{equation}
\text{Player MR} = (\text{Avg. IRS} \times 100) + \text{Consistency Factor}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Avg. IRS} is the average IdeaRank Score across all completed matches
  \item \textbf{Consistency Factor} rewards stable performance (reduces penalty for outliers)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coach Meta Rating}

\begin{equation}
\text{Coach MR} = (\text{Player improvement rate} \times 0.8) + (\text{Match success} \times 0.2)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Player improvement rate} measures average increase in player IRS under coaching
  \item \textbf{Match success} reflects the absolute performance of coached players
\end{itemize}

\section{Advancement Thresholds}

Participants advance between classes upon reaching MR thresholds:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Transition} & \textbf{MR Threshold} & \textbf{Additional Requirements} \\ \midrule
\textbf{Class A $\rightarrow$ B} & $\geq 650$ & 10+ matches in Class A \\
\textbf{Class B $\rightarrow$ C} & $\geq 800$ & 15+ matches in Class B \\
\textbf{Master Certification} & $\geq 950$ & $\geq 10$ verified matches in Class C \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class Advancement Requirements}
\label{tab:advancement_requirements}
\end{table}

\section{Advancement Process}

\subsection{Eligibility Review}

When a participant reaches an advancement threshold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Automatic notification} sent to participant and coach
  \item \textbf{Performance review} by Advancement Committee (3–5 business days)
  \item \textbf{Verification} of match data integrity and eligibility criteria
  \item \textbf{Advancement confirmation} or feedback on remaining gaps
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Provisional Advancement}

Newly advanced participants enter their new class with \textbf{provisional status}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item First 5 matches are monitored closely
  \item If MR drops below threshold ($-50$ MR), may be returned to previous class
  \item After 5 successful matches, status becomes permanent
\end{itemize}

\section{Demotion}

Participants may be demoted if:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item MR falls below class threshold by $\geq 100$ points
  \item Sustained poor performance over 20+ consecutive matches
  \item Request voluntary demotion (e.g., for coaching development purposes)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Demotion is not punitive}—it ensures appropriate challenge level and continued growth.

\section{Master Certification}

\textbf{Master Certification} represents the pinnacle of MetaSPN achievement.

\subsection{Requirements}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Meta Rating $\geq 950$
  \item Minimum 10 verified matches in Class C
  \item Demonstrated expertise across all three round types (Exploration, Execution, Reflection)
  \item Positive Coaching Impact when coaching others (applicable to both players and coaches)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benefits}

Master-certified participants gain:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Challenge design privileges} (propose new games for league use)
  \item \textbf{Referee certification} eligibility
  \item \textbf{Governance participation} (eligibility for Council membership)
  \item \textbf{Priority matching} in Special Division exhibitions
  \item \textbf{Public Master Registry} listing with achievement highlights
\end{itemize}

\section{Specialized Tracks}

Advanced participants may pursue specialized tracks:

\subsection{Coaching Specialist}

Focus on coach development and meta-coaching:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Train other coaches
  \item Develop coaching systems and methodologies
  \item High CI scores across diverse player types
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Designer}

Focus on creating new games and formats:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Design cognitive challenges
  \item Calibrate difficulty and IdeaRank alignment
  \item Contribute to league game library
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Referee}

Focus on officiating and integrity enforcement:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Complete referee training and certification
  \item Officiate matches with high accuracy
  \item Participate in appeal reviews
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Researcher}

Focus on cognitive science and AI development:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Analyze MetaSPN data for insights
  \item Publish research using league data
  \item Contribute to IdeaRank refinement
\end{itemize}

\section{Rank Display \& Recognition}

Participant rankings are displayed on:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Public leaderboards} (by class and division)
  \item \textbf{Participant profiles} (match history, MR trajectory)
  \item \textbf{Achievement badges} (milestones, specializations)
\end{itemize}

Rankings update weekly based on recent match performance.
