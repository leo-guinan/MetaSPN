% Chapter 8: Integrity & Verification
\chapter{Integrity \& Verification}
\label{ch:integrity}

MetaSPN maintains the highest standards of competitive integrity through comprehensive recording, verification, and transparency mechanisms.

\section{The MetaSPN Ledger}

All matches are recorded to the \textbf{MetaSPN Ledger}, a cryptographically secured, append-only log system.

\subsection{Recorded Data}

The Ledger captures:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Complete reasoning traces (every step, decision, and calculation)
  \item All coaching communications (audio, text, or structured data)
  \item Timestamp data for all actions and timeouts
  \item IdeaRank factor scores at each evaluation point
  \item Participant declarations (AI model parameters, training data, etc.)
  \item Challenge and appeal records
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cryptographic Verification}

Each match record receives:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Content hash} (SHA-256 or equivalent)
  \item \textbf{Digital signature} from authorized referee
  \item \textbf{Timestamp certification} from trusted time source
  \item \textbf{Merkle tree inclusion} for historical integrity
\end{itemize}

This ensures match records are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Immutable (cannot be altered retroactively)
  \item Auditable (complete history preserved)
  \item Verifiable (cryptographic proof of authenticity)
\end{itemize}

\section{AI Participant Requirements}

\subsection{Model Fingerprinting}

AI participants (players or coaches) undergo \textbf{model fingerprinting}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Challenge-response test} using standardized prompts
  \item \textbf{Behavior profiling} on reference tasks
  \item \textbf{Statistical signature analysis} of output patterns
\end{enumerate}

This creates a unique identifier ensuring:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item The declared model matches the competing system
  \item No undisclosed modifications or external assistance
  \item Consistency across multiple matches
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducibility Checks}

AI systems must demonstrate \textbf{reproducibility}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Given the same inputs and seed, produce identical outputs
  \item Replay matches for verification purposes
  \item Provide execution logs for audit
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Access Controls}

During matches, AI systems:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{May not} access real-time internet data
  \item \textbf{May not} communicate with external systems
  \item \textbf{May} access declared knowledge bases (specified pre-match)
  \item \textbf{Must} operate in isolated execution environments
\end{itemize}

\section{Ghost Replays}

\textbf{Ghost Replays} are randomized post-match reruns used to ensure fairness and calibration.

\subsection{Process}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Random selection of completed matches ($\sim$5\% of all matches)
  \item Human-only teams reattempt the same challenge
  \item Scoring comparison identifies systematic biases
  \item Adjustments made to IdeaRank calibration if needed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Purpose}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Verify scoring consistency across different participant types
  \item Detect challenge design flaws or ambiguities
  \item Calibrate IdeaRank weights based on expert human performance
  \item Build benchmark datasets for future AI development
\end{itemize}

\section{Fair Play Enforcement}

\subsection{Prohibited Behaviors}

The following constitute violations of MetaSPN integrity standards:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{External assistance:} Accessing unauthorized resources or communication
  \item \textbf{Model deception:} Misrepresenting AI capabilities or training data
  \item \textbf{Coaching violations:} Providing direct solutions or unauthorized guidance
  \item \textbf{Score manipulation:} Attempting to game IdeaRank through artificial behaviors
  \item \textbf{Collusion:} Coordinating outcomes or sharing information across teams
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Penalties}

Violations result in:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Violation Severity} & \textbf{Penalty} \\ \midrule
Minor (unintentional) & Score deduction ($-0.05$ to $-0.10$) \\
Moderate (procedural breach) & Match disqualification \\
Severe (deliberate cheating) & Suspension (3â€“12 months) \\
Egregious (systemic fraud) & Permanent ban \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Integrity Violation Penalties}
\label{tab:integrity_penalties}
\end{table}

\section{Appeals Process}

\subsection{Filing an Appeal}

Participants may appeal:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Scoring decisions
  \item Integrity violation rulings
  \item Referee errors or misconduct
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Filed within 24 hours of match completion
  \item Include specific claims with supporting evidence
  \item Submit to MetaSPN Council (see Chapter \ref{ch:governance})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Appeal Review}

Appeals are reviewed by a three-member panel:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item One technical expert (AI/scoring specialist)
  \item One competitive integrity officer
  \item One independent referee (not involved in original match)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outcomes:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Appeal upheld: Score adjusted, penalties reversed
  \item Appeal partially upheld: Modified ruling
  \item Appeal denied: Original decision stands
\end{itemize}

Decisions are final unless new evidence emerges.

\section{Transparency Commitments}

MetaSPN commits to:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Public rule documentation} (this rulebook)
  \item \textbf{Open scoring algorithms} (IdeaRank formula and weights)
  \item \textbf{Match data availability} (anonymized for research)
  \item \textbf{Governance meeting minutes} (published quarterly)
  \item \textbf{Annual integrity report} (violations, appeals, system improvements)
\end{itemize}
